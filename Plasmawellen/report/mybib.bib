    abstract={The absolute electron density in the downstream region of a 2.45 GHz microwave plasma source has been measured by the plasma oscillation method. In the plasma oscillation method a weak electron beam injected into the plasma excites electrostatic electron waves oscillating at the electron plasma frequency, which is proportional to the square root of the electron density. The plasma source is a slot antenna (SLAN) type, that is the microwave power is coupled from a ring resonator through equidistantly positioned resonant coupling slots into the plasma chamber which is made of quartz. The results of the plasma oscillation method are compared with the results of single and double Langmuir probe (LP) measurements. In Ar and Ar:O 2 mixtures reasonable agreement between the two diagnostic methods is found. However, in depositing plasmas traditional LPs cannot be used with confidence. We studied Ar:O 2 gas mixtures with hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) added downstream for the deposition of quartz-like films. We found that even a small amount of HMDSO in the gas mixture leads to erroneous LP measurements due to probe surface coating, while the plasma oscillation method is still applicable here.}

    abstract={A new and simple method for precise measurements of electron density in a plasma with use of plasma oscillations is described. A weak electron beam is injected from a hot filament and excites electron waves oscillating at the plasma frequency ω p , whose sharp spectrum, obtained using a detector, gives the electron density. This plasma oscillation method is free of many difficulties often encountered with a Langmuir probe, such as thin film deposition, plasma potential fluctuation, and magnetic fields. The measurement technique is theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated in the density measurements of an inductively coupled rf plasma, together with a comparison with the Langmuir probe method.}
