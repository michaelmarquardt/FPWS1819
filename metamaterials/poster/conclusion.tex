\begin{itemize}

\item{The split rings and the full rings overlap.} 
\item{The FTIR-spectra shows the expected behaviour, that means resonances, also when they are not so clear in comparision to the theory.}
\item{The overlapping of the rings prohibits that properties of metamaterials can occur.}
\item{Consequently one of the steps of the fabrication of the metamaterial was not succesfully, probably the annealing and wrong angles during the evaporation.}
\end{itemize}
