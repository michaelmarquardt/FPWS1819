\begin{itemize}
    \item A scanning electron microscope uses a focused electron beam in a raster scan pattern.
    The following SEM images show the metamaterial probes.
    The bright areas are the gold films and the dark one are bare substrate.
    \item One can see that the produced rings overlap.
    This will disturb the expected metamaterial behavior because a current can flow from one ring to another.
    There are two possible explanations for this overlap:
    %A possible reasons for this overlap is insufficient annealing time.
    %The size of the holes in the mask is then too big.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Insufficient annealing time leads to too big holes in the mask.
        \item A too wide angle $\theta$ leads to too big ring diameters.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
